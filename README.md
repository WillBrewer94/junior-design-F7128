BZZ Customer Delivery Document

Bzz is a location based rhythm game designed for mobile phones. Its themes have been chosen in order to appeal to Georgia Tech students. This manifests mainly in our monster design. While the overworld of the game is based in Pokemon Go-esque location tracking, the core gameplay loop involves responding to rhythmic prompts by swiping your finger, or in this test case your mouse, across the screen.

Playing the Game
The game begins at an intro screen where a player can register and then log into an account. To create an account, simply select the register option and create an account on the registration page. This account can then be used to access the game. 

Once the player has logged in, the player will be presented with the map screen. This is where the player will access combat by tapping enemies that appear on the map. Additionally, there are buttons to access the character screens.

Gameplay consists of an image of a monster, its current health, indicators of whether you hit or not, a combo meter, and the prompts themselves. Since the current version is not mobile phone ready, the swipes that a player performs to match the prompts is carried about by clicking and dragging the mouse across the screen in time with the rhythm of the game.
